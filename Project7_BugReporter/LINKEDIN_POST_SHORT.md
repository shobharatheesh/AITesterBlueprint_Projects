## 📝 POST 1: The One-Liner

```
I built an AI that writes JIRA tickets from screenshots.

30 seconds. Not 15 minutes.

#QA #Testing #AI
```

---

## 📝 POST 2: The Value Prop

```
📸 Screenshot → 🤖 AI → 🎫 JIRA Ticket

No typing. No formatting. No templates.

Just upload and done.

Built for QA Engineers who'd rather find bugs than document them.

## 📝 POST 3: The Problem/Solution

```
Finding bugs is fun.
Writing bug reports is not.

So I automated it.

🐞 AI Bug Reporter

Upload screenshot → Get JIRA ticket → Back to testing

That's it.

## 📝 POST 4: The Stats Hook

```
Bug reporting: 15 minutes → 30 seconds

AI does the work:
• Analyzes screenshots
• Writes descriptions
• Lists steps
• Sets severity

You just click "Create in JIRA"

Game changer for QA teams.
