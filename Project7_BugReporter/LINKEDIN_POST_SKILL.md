## 📝 POST OPTION 1: The "How It Works" Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
```
I built an AI tool that writes JIRA tickets from screenshots.

No more copy-pasting.
No more formatting.
No more "Steps to Reproduce" writer's block.

Just: Screenshot → AI → JIRA Ticket

Here's how it works 👇
```

### Slide 2: The Problem
```
❌ OLD WAY (15 minutes per bug):
1. Take screenshot
2. Open JIRA
3. Fill summary
4. Write description
5. List steps
6. Add environment
7. Set severity/priority
8. Upload screenshot
9. Create ticket

😩 Repetitive. Slow. Boring.
```

### Slide 3: The Solution
```
✅ NEW WAY (30 seconds):
1. Upload screenshot
2. AI analyzes the image
3. JIRA ticket auto-generated
4. Click "Create in JIRA"

🚀 Done.

The AI does the work:
• Identifies the UI issue
• Writes the description
• Lists steps to reproduce
• Classifies severity & priority
• Identifies module & feature
```

### Slide 4: The Result
```
📸 Input: Screenshot of broken login button

🤖 AI Analysis:
"Login button unresponsive on Chrome. 
Critical severity. Authentication module."

🎫 Output: Professional JIRA ticket
• Summary
• Description  
• Steps to reproduce
• Expected vs Actual results
• Environment details
• Severity: Critical
• Priority: P1

One click to create in JIRA.
```

### Slide 5: The Features
```
📊 Export Options:
• 📕 PDF (Professional report)
• 📊 Excel (Test case format)
• 📄 TXT (Quick share)
• 📦 JSON (API integration)
• 🔗 Direct JIRA creation

⚡ Tech Stack:
• React + Vite
• Groq AI Vision
• JIRA REST API
```

## 📝 POST OPTION 2: The "Before vs After" Story

```
**BEFORE:**
Me: *finds a bug* 🐞
Also me: *opens JIRA*
Also me: *stares at blank description field*
Also me: *"What did I click again?"*
Also me: *15 minutes later...*

**AFTER:**
Me: *uploads screenshot* 📸
AI: *analyzes in 5 seconds* 🤖
JIRA: *ticket created* 🎫
Me: *back to finding more bugs* ✅

I built an AI Bug Reporter that:
✅ Analyzes screenshots using Vision AI
✅ Auto-generates JIRA-ready bug reports
✅ Classifies severity & priority automatically
✅ Creates tickets directly in JIRA
✅ Exports to PDF, Excel, TXT, JSON

The process:
1️⃣ Upload screenshot
2️⃣ Add optional context
3️⃣ AI generates structured report
4️⃣ One-click JIRA creation

What used to take 15 minutes now takes 30 seconds.

QA Engineers: Would you use this?

## 📝 POST OPTION 4: The "Pain Point" Hook

```
**"Write a detailed bug report for this issue."**

Every QA Engineer's least favorite task.

It's not finding bugs that sucks.
It's documenting them.

So I automated it.

🐞 AI Bug Reporter

How it works:
📸 You: Upload screenshot
🤖 AI: Analyzes UI elements
📝 AI: Writes description
📋 AI: Lists reproduction steps
🏷️ AI: Classifies severity
🎯 AI: Sets priority
🎫 You: Click "Create in JIRA"

The AI acts like a Senior QA Engineer:
• Identifies broken UI elements
• Describes the issue clearly
• Writes actionable steps
• Knows severity rules (Blocker vs Trivial)
• Understands priority (P1 vs P4)

Result?
15-minute bug reports → 30 seconds

Your time is better spent FINDING bugs, not WRITING about them.

## 📝 POST OPTION 7: The "Behind The Scenes" Technical

```
**How I Built an AI Bug Reporter** 🧠🐞

**The Challenge:**
QA Engineers spend 30% of their time writing bug reports.
Same format. Different details. Repetitive.

**The Solution:**
Vision AI that analyzes screenshots and generates JIRA tickets.

**Technical Architecture:**

```javascript
// 1. User uploads screenshot
const screenshot = await fileToBase64(file);

// 2. Groq Vision AI analyzes
const analysis = await groq.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17e',
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: [
      { type: 'image_url', image_url: screenshot },
      { type: 'text', text: 'Analyze this UI bug' }
    ]
  }]
});

// 3. Structured JIRA ticket output
const ticket = {
  summary: analysis.summary,
  description: analysis.description,
  stepsToReproduce: analysis.steps,
  severity: analysis.severity, // AI-classified
  priority: analysis.priority  // AI-assigned
};

// 4. Create in JIRA
await jira.createIssue(ticket);
```

**Key Features:**
• Base64 image encoding for API transport
• Structured JSON output with strict prompts
• Temperature 0.1 for deterministic results
• Multi-format exports (PDF, Excel, JSON)
• Direct JIRA REST API integration

**Result:**
15-minute bug reports → 30 seconds
