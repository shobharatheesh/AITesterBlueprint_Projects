**Excited to share my latest project: AI Bug Reporter** 🐞🤖

As a QA Engineer, I know the pain of manually writing bug reports—analyzing screenshots, categorizing severity, and formatting everything for JIRA. So I built something to change that.

**What it does:**
📸 Upload a screenshot → AI analyzes the UI issue → Generates a production-ready JIRA ticket in seconds

**The Tech Stack:**
⚛️ React + Vite for blazing-fast UI
🧠 Groq AI (Vision Model) for intelligent image analysis
🎨 Vanilla CSS with glassmorphism design
📊 jsPDF + XLSX for professional report exports
🔌 JIRA REST API integration for one-click ticket creation

**Key Features:**
✅ Auto-detects Severity (Blocker/Critical/Major/Minor/Trivial)
✅ Auto-assigns Priority (P1-P4)
✅ Identifies Module & Feature from screenshot
✅ Exports to PDF, Excel, TXT, and JSON
✅ Creates JIRA issues directly
✅ Dark-mode premium UI

**Real-world impact:**
What used to take 10-15 minutes per bug report now takes 30 seconds. QA teams can focus on finding bugs, not documenting them.

This project taught me a lot about AI vision models, REST API integration, and creating enterprise-ready tools. The future of QA is intelligent automation!

💬 Would love to hear your thoughts on AI-powered testing tools!

**Built an AI that writes bug reports for you.** 🐞⚡

Upload a screenshot → Get a JIRA-ready ticket. That's it.

✅ Vision AI analyzes UI issues
✅ Auto-categorizes severity & priority  
✅ Exports PDF/Excel/JIRA
✅ Built with React + Groq AI

As QA Engineers, we should spend time FINDING bugs, not DOCUMENTING them.

**How I Built an AI-Powered Bug Reporter** 🧠🐞

**The Problem:**
Writing bug reports is repetitive. Same format, different details. 10-15 minutes per ticket.

**The Solution:**
An intelligent web app that acts like a Senior QA Engineer—analyzing screenshots and generating structured JIRA tickets automatically.

**Architecture Decisions:**

🎯 **Frontend:** React + Vite
- Component-based architecture
- State management with hooks
- Responsive glassmorphism UI

🧠 **AI Engine:** Groq API (Llama Vision)
- Base64 image encoding for API transport
- Structured JSON output with strict prompts
- Temperature 0.1 for deterministic results

📊 **Export System:**
- jsPDF for professional PDF reports
- XLSX for Excel test case format
- Includes proper Test ID generation
- Table formatting with headers

🔌 **JIRA Integration:**
- REST API v3 for issue creation
- Basic Auth with API tokens
- Atlassian Document Format (ADF) for descriptions
- Error handling with human-readable messages

**Challenges Solved:**
• CORS issues with JIRA API
• PDF encoding with special characters
• Excel cell formatting & multi-sheet exports
• Permission checking before API calls

**Result:**
30-second bug reports vs 15-minute manual process. Enterprise-ready.

## 📎 COMMENT TEMPLATES

**When someone asks about tech stack:**
"Great question! I used:
• React + Vite for the frontend
• Groq AI (vision model) for screenshot analysis
• jsPDF & XLSX libraries for exports
• JIRA REST API for ticket creation

All vanilla JavaScript/CSS—no heavy UI frameworks. Kept it lightweight!"

**When someone asks about AI accuracy:**
"The AI uses Groq's Llama vision model with temperature 0.1 for consistent outputs. It's trained to identify UI elements, errors, and classify severity based on visual cues. Works great for clear UI issues—complex backend errors need more context."

**When someone wants to use it:**
"I'd love feedback! The repo is public on GitHub. Feel free to fork it, open issues, or contribute. It's designed to be plug-and-play—just add your Groq API key and you're good to go!"
