# Create LinkedIn Posts

## Purpose
To generate short, clear, and high-engagement (clickbaity) LinkedIn posts based on a specific topic provided by the user.

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when:
- You need inspiration for a LinkedIn post.
- You want to increase engagement with catchy headlines and content.
- You have a topic but need help crafting the post.

## Instructions
1.  **Receive Topic**: Wait for the user to provide a specific TOPIC.
2.  **Generate Options**: Create 2-3 distinct LinkedIn post options.
3.  **Style Guidelines**:
    -   **Clickbaity & Catchy**: Use strong hooks, questions, or controversial statements to grab attention.
    -   **Short & Clear**: Keep paragraphs short (1-2 sentences). Use bullet points if necessary. Total length should be optimized for mobile reading.
    -   **Call to Action (CTA)**: End with a question or engagement prompt.
    -   **Formatting**: Use bolding for emphasis. Use appropriate emojis but don't overdo it.
4.  **Presentation**:
    -   Present the options clearly separated (e.g., Option 1, Option 2).
    -   Ask the user to choose the best one or request revisions.
